## Welcome to WhatCr.app

If you're reading this, the whole point of this project is just a placeholder because I thought the new .app TLD was amusing, and I wanted
to point the domain at something besides a parked page. It's not likely to turn into anything great. If you want to see something
that I actually plan on building out further with potential to turn into a product, see https://www.ochokochoi.com/

## Summary of WhatCr.app

It's all crapp here.

At WhatCr.app, we believe in underpromising. You know that old "underpromise, overdeliver" thing? Yeah, no, we don't do that. We don't promise anything, and we only deliver crap.

Glad we could help you.
